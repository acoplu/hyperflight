HyperFlight
Our project aims to create an interface that displays real-time flight information on a map. Users will be able to track flights, view their routes, and collect relevant details about each flight such as altitude, latitude, and longitude.

Implementation Plan:
Map Integration: Integrate ADS-B API data with a map to provide an intuitive user experience.
Real-Time Updates: Implement a system for real-time updates to ensure that the information displayed remains current and accurate.
Flight Details: In addition to basic information, include detailed flight information such as aircraft type, departure point, destination, and current speed.
User Interaction: Add features that allow users to interact with the displayed data, such as filtering by specific criteria or selecting individual flights for more information.

API/Libraries:
ADSB Exchange API: OpenSky Network
Maps API: OpenLayers, OpenStreetMap
Libraries: OpenLayers for JavaScript - ol, vite
