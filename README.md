## HyperFlight

Our project aims to create an interface that displays real-time flight information on a map. Users will be able to track flights, view their routes, and collect relevant details about each flight such as altitude, latitude, and longitude.

### Implementation Plan:

- **Map Integration:** Integrate ADS-B API data with a map to provide an intuitive user experience.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Implement a system for real-time updates to ensure that the information displayed remains current and accurate.
- **Flight Details:** In addition to basic information, include detailed flight information such as aircraft type, departure point, destination, and current speed.
- **User Interaction:** Add features that allow users to interact with the displayed data, such as filtering by specific criteria or selecting individual flights for more information.

### API/Libraries:

- **ADSB Exchange API:** [OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org)
- **Maps API:** [HERE Developer](https://developer.here.com), [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org), [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org)
